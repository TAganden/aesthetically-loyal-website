about_the_work:
The common link between the works shown on this site is a subversion of the traditional graphic design process. The prescribed method of taking a series of design concepts, incrementally improving and delimiting from that selection is reversed in favour of a process based in impulsivity. This process outcome is primarily due to having to conceptualise and complete projects in extremely short timeframes, but nonetheless poses an workable alternative to the 'traditional' design process model.
