project_information: 
This project formed the poster for Yes Diggity's first birthday party at Miss Libertines. It was a literal progression of the brand into the physical realm. We formed a numeral one using the diamonds from the logo's crown, constructed from folded pieces of cardboard, hand-folded, pasted onto our wall and photographed.
The accompanying type treatment was an exercise in extending the concept of the monospaced font to a mono-hierarchical structure, forcing only colour and text decoration to highlight the degrees of importance within the information.
