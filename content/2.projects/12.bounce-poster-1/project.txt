final_output: A3 poster

client: Opulent

project_information: 
This poster served as an introduction to the public of a series of nights run by the Opulent Magazine family. We collected a cluster of objects which personified the direction of the night, constructing and photographing it over the course of a day in the corner of their Melbourne studio. It was an interesting process, involving the client heavily in the construction of the poster meant shifting my role from primary producer to a position more akin to that of an art director.
