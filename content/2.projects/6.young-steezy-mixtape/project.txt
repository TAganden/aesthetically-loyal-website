project_information: 
The mixtape was a giveaway for one of the earlier Favela Rock parties. The title _Robbin it Steady_, was a reference to one of the many pseudonyms of DJ Young Steezy of the Deuce Crew. The CD was laser-printed, hand-scored and cut in a run of around 50.

The illustration was a thematic reference to the chain-stealing culture within hip hop; a reflection upon the content of the mixtape.
