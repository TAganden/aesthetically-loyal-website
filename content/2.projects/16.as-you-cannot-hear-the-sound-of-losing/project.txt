project_information: 
_As You Cannot Hear The Sound of Losing_ was a performance installation executed within an apartment on the 47th floor of the Eureka Towers. It explored Baudrillard's notion of the _hyperreal_ and how it can be related to the contemporary gaming environment.

The title and poster alludes to an absence of the signification of _losing_ within these constructed places.
