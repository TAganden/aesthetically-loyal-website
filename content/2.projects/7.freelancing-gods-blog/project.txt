project_information: 
The Freelancing-Gods blog was designed for a programmer ex-colleague as a space for his thoughts and open-source Ruby projects. The illustration is a portrait of the (far from egotistical) principal author behind the blog. It was an interpretation of classical catholic iconicism, taking the egotism and pseudo-religiousness of the name and twisting it into self-parody.

The idea behind the layout was a translation of traditional print and typographic rules, forcibly applying them to the web. Baseline and horizontal grid structures from editorial and book design were appropriated to add a simulated sense of tradition and weight to the content.
