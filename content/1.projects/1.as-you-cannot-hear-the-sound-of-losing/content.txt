project_information: 
<em>As You Cannot Hear The Sound of Losing</em> was a performance installation executed within an apartment on the 47th floor of the Eureka Towers. It explored Baudrillard's notion of the <em>hyperreal</em> and how it can be related to the contemporary gaming environment.
The title and poster alludes to an absence of the signification of <em>losing</em> within these constructed places.
