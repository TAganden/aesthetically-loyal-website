project_information: 
The Kellermeister typeface was one of my first real forays into systematic, exploratory typography. The idea involved creating a modal 'alphabet' of limited shapes and connectors, then from that geometrically constructing a typeface. Its intention was also to push each letterform to as pure an aesthetic as possible without losing its legible differentiation and maintaining its function within a working alphabet.
The name is a reference to J.R.R Tolkien's writings on phonoaesthetics and cellar doors in <em>The Monsters and the Critics</em>, which seemed appropriate for a typeface exploring the pure aesthetics of its own construction from a pre-defined set of geometric 'phonemes'.
