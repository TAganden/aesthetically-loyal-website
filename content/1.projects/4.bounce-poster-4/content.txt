project_information: 
The fourth Bounce poster represented a major geographical and conceptual shift as the night was moving away from its original home at Third Class. To celebrate the occasion we created a miniature (1/250 scale) diorama based around the venue and its iconic na&iuml;ve neon graffitied walls. The packed bags represented not only Bounce's departure, but also the propositional end of Third Class as one of Melbourne's premier club night venues.
