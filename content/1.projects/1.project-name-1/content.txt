project_information: 
As You Cannot Hear The Sound of Losing was a performance installation executed within an apartment on the 47th floor of the Eureka Towers. It explored Baudrillard's notion of the hyperreal and how it can be related to the contemporary gaming environment.
The title and poster alludes to an absence of the signification of losing within these constructed places.
